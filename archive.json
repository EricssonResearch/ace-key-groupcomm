Two permissions apply to topics: 'publish' and 'subscribe'. An example scope field may contain multiple such strings, space delimited, e.g., 'publish_topic1 subscribe_topic2/#'. Hence, this access token would give 'publish' permission to the 'topic1', 'subscribe' permission to all the subtopics of 'topic2'.\r\n\r\nThis is how MQTT encodes multiple topics and roles. I think that should not be a problem as long as all these use the same security keying material.",

It could apply to the joining process and to POST to pub-key (where the node post a new public key to the KDC). These are quite perpendicular though (1 -> joining, 2 -> pub-key, 3 -> not supported), so I am not sure what this adds\u2026 This could be covering the join \u2013 leave \u2013 rejoin with the same token process, that is not very well covered right now, is that something we need to expand on?\r\n\r\n> I believe that one needs to look at the following cases:\r\n\r\n> No public key with the right parameters has been associated with the token - in this case both the key and proof are required\r\n\r\nWhat we do say is that key and proof of possession are required during join process if KDC collects and distribute keys, and the client is a sender. So one key will always be associated with the token. 1 is a quite convoluted way to say: \u201calways at joining\u201d (which we already say\u2026) or is this supposed to cover another case?\r\n\r\n\r\n> One public key with the right parameters has been associated with the token - in this case the following would seem to be fine a) neither are present, b) just the key is present (proof already has been done), c) both are present\r\n\r\nAre we talking about after joining, posting a new pub key to the KDC? Then both are needed. Unless the key is the same\u2026in which case it is useless to repost the same to pub-key.\r\n\r\n> Multiple public keys with the right parameters have been associated with the token - In this case the following would seem to be fine a) just the key is present (proof has already been done) or b) both are present\r\n\r\nThe KDC only keeps one public key per node (see pub-key handler), this is not supported. In what case would the client want to associate more than one key? Is this something we want?\r\n\r\n\r\n> Such a change would seem to maximize the number of times that the public key can be omitted and an even greater number of times the proof can be omitted. In the event that the proof is needed, the error would return a new server nonce to be used in the re-sent join message.\r\n\r\nI think right now we already cover the case where the key and proof MUST be sent in each section.

The problem is then how to differentiate between those 2 (which one is used with each application). It could be solved, but I guess it's not worth the headache. I will remove the generality (make it specialised to ace key groupcomm) and change the name to reflect that.\r\n\r\n(Just for record, the reason for wanting to register a more general rsnonce is that we are already registering client and server nonces with specific functions in the OSCORE profile, and the cnonce defined in ace also has a very specific function, so I was thinking let's register *one* parameter that can be used as rs nonce by the application and let the application decide how to use it, rather than keep registering nonces for specific functions).",

This requires a mandate to the client that it only create a given GID/KID context once. The client can't provide that in the *general* case -- it might just be starting up, request the context, start using it, get powercycled, send request it again, use the response, and BOOM goes the crypto.\r\n\r\nHowever, when an ACE profile is used that has some forms of sessions (the nonces of ace-oscore-profile, or the ... well, sessions (epochs?) for DTLS), it may be permissible to allow idempotent implementations that send the same response just again, *if* clients can be required to not initialize a KID context twice from responses of the same session with the GM. That seems to be a reasonable thing to ask from the clients; it's probably more work specifying than implementing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nGranted, it's a small optimization, so feel free to turn this down if it sounds excessive. It may easily be that this is just the point where even stacks that previously got away with requiring resource idempotency just need deduplication.",
